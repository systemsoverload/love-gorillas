QBasic Gorillas Clone Re-Implemented With Love2D

TODO -
	* Add sounds!
	* Add explosion animation
	* Gorilla animations on throw and victory
	* Menu screen for setting name and gravity for each player
	* Randomize building textures better

KNOWN BUGS -
	* Player 2's angles need to be reversed
	* Explosions happening after banana exiting an explosion aren't colliding exactly where we want
	* Sometimes explosions are hanging around after generating a new level
	* Turn doesn't end if the banana is thrown off of the screen
